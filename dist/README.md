# Restaurank
Semestral project for the A4M33VIA subject at FEE CTU.

The purpose of this project is to provide a platform, which would find nearby restaurants, filter them according to some criteria (card payment allowed, open after midnight, have draft beer etc.) and display a list sorted by their rank/distance. Additionally, being able to web crawl their (especially lunch) menu would be a nice to have feature.
